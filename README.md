interestingly how I can I use a Notion simulator, that will enable me to scroll .txt files?



media-reader1.tsx, this can load image and text, and will separate the two. First dropdown (text files) can be controlled by the right arrow.  Loading files can be doing using shift and then click down to open multiple files.



and the bottom image scrollbar can be scrolled by the left arrow





Media-reader-2.txt have them side by side panels



media-reader-3.tsx

here is the the main code for loading media files along with images.  I think this will be great in looking at notes and looking at images side by side. 

right and left arrows toggle the text files, and up and down arrows toggle the image/media files.



clicking on the top right is to get the prompt to load the files
