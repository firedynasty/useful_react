interestingly how I can I use a Notion simulator, that will enable me to scroll .txt files?



 media-reader1.tsx, this can load image and text, and will separate the two. First dropdown (text files) can be controlled by the right arrow, 



and the bottom image scrollbar can be scrolled by the left arrow
