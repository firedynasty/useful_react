Prompt: great, this works, for shared content can you maximize the image window? pehaps make the headers smaller font and buttons smaller font?

I'll modify the ContentReader component to maximize the image display area by adjusting the spacing and font sizes.

I've made several adjustments to maximize the image display area and create a more compact interface:

1. Reduced header font sizes to text-xs
2. Made all buttons smaller (height: h-8) and reduced their font size
3. Reduced padding in card content areas
4. Increased the maximum height of the image to 70vh (70% of the viewport height)
5. Made tab text smaller
6. Reduced spacing between elements
7. Made the text content slightly smaller

These changes will make the interface more compact while giving more space to the actual content, especially images. The image will now scale up to 70% of your viewport height while maintaining its aspect ratio.
